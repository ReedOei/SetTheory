We write $A \subseteq_c B$ and $B \supseteq_c A$ to mean that $\closure{A} \subseteq B$.

Define the \emph{Banach-Mazur} game $G^{**}(A)$ as follows for a subset $A$ of a Polish space $X$.
Let $\mathcal{W}$ be a countable weak basis for $X$, i.e., a countable collection of nonempty open sets such that every nonempty open set $U \subseteq X$ contains at least one $W \in \mathcal{W}$.
The a run of the Banach-Mazur game is a sequence $(U_0, V_0, U_1, V_1, \ldots)$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item $U_n, V_n \in \mathcal{W}$ for all $n$
    \item $\diam{U_n} < 1/n$ and $\diam{W_n} < 1/n$ for all $n$
    \item $U_0 \supseteq_c V_0 \supseteq_c U_1 \supseteq_c U_1 \supseteq_c V_1 \supseteq_c \ldots$
\end{enumerate}
Let $x \in X$ be such that $\curlys{x} = \bigcap_n \overline{U_n} = \bigcap_n \overline{V_n}$.
Then Player I wins if and only if $x \in A$.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:forces-baire-meas}
    Let $X$ be a Baire space, and let $U \subseteq X$ be a nonempty open set.
    Let $A$ and $B$ be subsets of $X$.
    If $U \forces A$, and $A \forces B$, then $U \forces B$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We have both $U \setminus A$ and $A \setminus B$ are meager.
    Suppose that $U \setminus B$ is not meager.
    Then by the Baire alternative, there is some nonempty open set $V \subseteq X$ such that $V \forces (U \setminus B)$.
    So then $V \setminus (U \setminus B) = (V \setminus U) \cup (V \cap B)$ is meager, so in particular, $V \cap B$ is meager.
    But then $B$ is meager, so $A$ must also be meager (recall $A \setminus B$ is meager), and similarly $U$ must be meager.

    But $X$ is a Baire space, and $U$ is a nonempty open set, so $U$ is nonmeager, and this is a contradiction.
    So then $U \setminus B$ must be meager, and $U \forces B$, as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:weak-basis-forces}
    Let $X$ be a Baire space, let $A_n \subseteq X$ be Baire measurable sets, and let $U \subseteq X$ be some nonempty open set.
    Then
    \[
        U \forces \bigcup_n A_n \iff \forall V \subseteq U \exists W \subseteq V \exists n (W \forces A_n)
    \]
    where $V$ and $W$ vary over some weak basis $\mathcal{W}$ for $X$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    $(\implies):$ Suppose that $U \forces \bigcup_n A_n$.
    Let $V \subseteq U$ such that $V \in \mathcal{W}$.
    Because each $A_n$ is Baire measurable, there is some open set $U_n$ such that $A_n =^* U_n$.
    Because $V \subseteq U$, we have $V \forces \bigcup_n A_n$, and so then $V \forces \bigcup_n U_n$ by Proposition~\ref{prop:forces-baire-meas}.
    That is, $V \setminus (\bigcup_n U_n)$ is meager.
    But $V$ is a nonempty open set in a Baire space, so it is nonmeager.
    So then for some $U_n$, we must have $V \cap U_n \neq \emptyset$.
    Taking this $U_n$, because $V \cap U_n$ is nonempty and open, there is some $W \in \mathcal{W}$ such that $W \subseteq V \cap U_n$ and $W \forces A_n$, as required.

\begin{proposition}[Exercise 79]
    Let $X$ be a Polish space, $F \subseteq X \times \N^{\N}$ a closed set, and $A = \proj{X}(F)$.
        If Player II has a winning strategy in the Banach-Mazur game $G^{**}(F,X)$, then $A$ is meager.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    First, note that $A$ is analytic, and so it is universally measurable, and in particular, Baire measurable.

    Suppose that Player II has a winning strategy, but $A$ is not meager.
    Then because $X$ is a Polish space, it is also a Baire space, so there is some nonempty open set $U \subseteq X$ such that $U \forces A$.

    Let $U_0 \subseteq U$ be some nonempty open set in $\mathcal{W}$.
    Then $U_0 \forces A$ as well.
    Player II will pick some set $V_0 \subseteq_c U_0$.
    But because $U_0 \forces A$ and $V_0 \subseteq U_0$, we know that there is some set $U_1 \subseteq V_0$ such that $U_1 \forces A$ by Proposition~\ref{prop:weak-basis-forces}.
    Clearly we can pick $U_1 \subseteq V_0$ such that $\diam{U_1} < 1/n$ and $U_1 \subseteq_c V_0$, because $X$ is metrizable.
    Then simply repeat this process to build the whole run of the game.

    Each $U_i$ is nonempty and open, so they are all nonmeager because $X$ is a Baire space.
    Then because each $U_i \forces A$, that is, $U_i \setminus A$ is meager, we must have $U_i \cap A \neq \emptyset$ (in fact, it must be nonmeager), so then the $x \in X$ such that $\curlys{x} = \bigcap_n \overline{U_n}$ must also be $x \in A$.
    But then Player I wins, contradicting that Player II has a winning strategy.
    So it must be that $A$ is meager.
\end{proof}
