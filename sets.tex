\section{Sets}

So far we've only talked about sets in a very informal sense, and we've briefly discussed a couple operations.
For example, I've said that $\curlys{1,2,3}$ is a set of three numbers, and that if I have two sets $A$ and $B$, I might take their union $A \cup B$ which is the set containing all the elements in $A$ and all the elements in $B$.
For finite sets, this all seems pretty intuitive, and it seems unlikely that we can go wrong with anything that's vaguely described in this manner.

However, for infinite sets, we have to realize that our intuition is often wrong, or at least incomplete.
