\section{The Kinds of Infinity}

In the previous section, we established that there are multiple kinds, or sizes, of infinity.
Or, at least, there are two: the things that are the same size as the positive integers, and the things that are as many as groups of positive integers.

\subsection{Some New Language}

Our language, while quite versatile, is not quite ideal for the topic at hand.
That previous sentence is probably very difficult to read, and is even more difficult to talk about with other people.
In fact, many of the previous sentences are, despite the author's best effort, difficult to parse.

To fix this problem, we're going to introduce some new words to make talking about groups and infinities a bit easier.

First, we're going to introduce so new terms for things we've been saying; in particular, we want to replace some common English terms with their technical versions, because using plain English terms can be misleading if we don't mean them in a colloquial sense.
Instead of ``group'', we'll use \emph{set} or \emph{collection}.
The things inside a set or collection are called \emph{elements}.
Note that order in a set doesn't matter, the set $\curlys{1,2}$ is the same as the set $\curlys{2,1}$; we only care what's in the set.
Instead of ``amount'', we will use \emph{cardinality}.
Then, instead of saying ``we have the same amount of students in the original class as there are chairs'', we'll say ``the collection of students in the new class has same cardinality as the set of chairs.''
This isn't shorter, but it's more precise: any mathematically trained person will know what we mean; if we use ``group'' and ``amount'', it's too vague to be sure what we're really talking about without going into more detail.
Instead of saying ``the set $A$ has the same cardinality as positive integers'', we'll say ``$A$ is \emph{countable}'', or ``there are \emph{countably many} elements of $A$''.
If some set is too big to have a good, complete assignment with a countable set, we'll say it is \emph{uncountable}.
Finally, instead of ``groups of things in a set $X$'' we'll say ``\emph{subsets} of $X$''; so then we can say ``the set of subsets of positive integers is uncountable.''
\reed{Is this too many new definitions to just throw at them?}
\reed{Should definitions be more rigorous?}

For some examples, $\curlys{1,2,3}$ is a group of things in the bigger group $\curlys{1,2,3,4,5}$, so $\curlys{1,2,3}$ is a \textbf{subset} of $\curlys{1,2,3,4,5}$.
Similarly, $\curlys{1}$ is a subset of $\curlys{1,2,3,4,5}$.
Finally, note that we consider the ``empty group'' or \emph{empty set}, $\emptyset := \curlys{}$, which has no elements to be a subset of \textbf{every} set.
\reed{How to build familiarity with the empty set and sets in general, but maintaining the flow?}
\reed{Is this even important right now?}

\subsection{How many sizes of infinity?}

As briefly discussed earlier, we've so far found two different kinds of infinity: countable and uncountable.
Is that all there is: specfically, if a set is uncountable, it is the same size as every other uncountable set?
\reed{I have literally no intuition for guessing what people will think about this...}

The answer is no, and we'll need one more term to talk about it: the \emph{powerset} of a set is the set of all subsets of that set.
So the powerset of $\curlys{1,2,3}$ is $\curlys{\emptyset, \curlys{1}, \curlys{2}, \curlys{3}, \curlys{1,2}, \curlys{1,3}, \curlys{2,3}, \curlys{1,2,3}}$.
By convention, for a set $A$, we consider both $\emptyset$ and $A$ to be subsets of $A$.
\reed{Should probably explain this convention...}
We write ``the powerset of a set $A$'' as $\powerset{A}$.
Then we can rephrase the earlier sentence about the powerset of $\curlys{1,2,3}$ as:

\[
    \powerset{\curlys{1,2,3}} = \curlys{\emptyset, \curlys{1}, \curlys{2}, \curlys{3}, \curlys{1,2}, \curlys{1,3}, \curlys{2,3}, \curlys{1,2,3}}
\]

Then we have the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}
    For any set $A$, the cardinality of the powerset of $A$, $\powerset{A}$, is greater than the cardinality of $A$; that is:

    \[
        \abs{\powerset{A}} > \abs{A}
    \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The proof here is almost the same as the previous section, where we showed that adding a new student for each group of students in the original class, or each subset of the students in the original class, gives a set of students that is larger than the original class.

    For the sake of a contradiction \reed{we should explain proof by contradiction at some point}, let's suppose that the two sets have the same cardinality, meaning there is a good, complete assignment of the elements in $A$ to the elements in $\powerset{A}$, which are subsets of $A$.
    That is, for every element $x$ of $A$, there is some subset of $A$, $A_x$; and every subset of $A$ is $A_x$ for some element $x$ of $A$.

    Consider the subset of $A$ which contains $x$ if and only if $x$ is \textbf{not} in $A_x$, and call this subset $B$.
    By our assumption, we must have $B = A_y$ for some element $y$ of $A$.
    But by definition, if $y$ is an element of $A_y$, then $y$ is not an element of $B$; if $y$ is not an element of $A_y$, then $y$ is an element of $B$.
    Therefore, the two sets \textbf{cannot} be the same, so there is some subset, namely $B$, which is missing from our list.
    So there cannot be any such good, complete assignment.
\end{proof}

But this brings up a new, very interesting question.

\begin{quote}
    If we have some set $A$, is there any set that has a cardinality greater than $A$, but less than $\powerset{A}$?
\end{quote}

At first, it may seem like the answer to this question is quite obvious.
If I have a set with $4$ things in it, like $\curlys{1,2,3,4}$, then the set $\curlys{1,2,3,4,5}$ is a bigger set, but it doesn't have as many things as the powerset of the original set.
And, indeed, whenever a set is finite, we can easily find such a set.
The question only really becomes interesting when we talk about infinite sets.

As we've seen, even if we add a single element to an infinite set, the infinite set doesn't become any ``bigger''; that is, the cardinality of the set remains the same.
In fact, even ``doubling'' and ``squaring'' the size of the set didn't make any difference in the cardinality.
The only operation we've seen so far that makes a difference is taking the powerset.
Anything less, and it seems that we can't increase the size of the set by enough to matter.

On the other hand, it seems like there ought to be some set with a cardinality between the powerset and the set itself.
After all, there's a lot of ``space'' in between these sets. \reed{clarify this point}

\subsection{Different Kinds of Numbers}

We've discussed and used a variety of different kinds of numbers throughout this book.
First, we talked about \reed{positive integers}: $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, etc.

But there are, of course, other kinds of numbers: what about $0$, $-10$, $\frac{1}{2}$, or the famous $\pi$?
Each of these numbers is a representative of a different kind of numbers.
Each kind of numbers forms a set of numbers.

We call the numbers $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and so on the \emph{natural numbers}, because they are ``natural'' in the sense that they are obviously useful for counting.
We denote the set of all natural numbers by $\nat$, which is just a fancy way to write an $N$.

The numbers like $-10$, $-5$, $2$, or $129$ are called \emph{integers}, coming from the Latin \emph{integer}, meaning ``whole''.
We can clearly see that every natural is itself an integer, but we also include the natural numbers.
\reed{Is this actually that obvious...I think so?}
We write the set of integers as $\integers$, because the German word for ``numbers'' is \emph{Zahlen}.

Next, we have numbers like $\frac{5}{2}$, $-\frac{11}{2}$, $\frac{129}{1819}$, and so on.
These numbers are called \emph{rational numbers}, because they are ``ratios'' of integers (where the bottom number is not $0$).
We write the set rational numbers as $\rational$ for ``quotient''.

\subsection{How many of each kind of number are there?}
