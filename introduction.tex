\section{Introduction}

In the beginning, man roamed the earth. \footnote{In reality: in the beginning there was probably a Big Bang followed by billions of years of no-Earth, followed by billions of years of no-humans, followed by just a few years of yes-humans.}
When someone saw something they liked, they took it, and when they saw many things they liked, they took them all.
If they saw no things they liked, they walked elsewhere.
